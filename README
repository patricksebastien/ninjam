Fork of NINJAM, www.ninjam.com to add Open Sound Control.
For now only as a client sending 2 commands:
- /restart (controlled by a sample accurate trigger)
- /bpm (when changed)

Super hackish, you need to compile it (I am using the cursesclient) to change the value (njclient.cpp).
It works for me...
